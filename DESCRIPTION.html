With Review Hotmouse, use <b>mouse shortcuts</b> to review easily and quickly.

For example, <b>Scroll down</b> to <i>show answer</i>, <b>scroll up</b> to answer 'again'.

<b>How to use</b>

By default, the hotmouses are configured as below.
You can customize the hotkey and their actions in the add-on config.
The shortcuts will only work while reviewing cards.

right click: undo
scroll down (front): show answer
scroll up (back): again
scroll down (back): good
middle button + scroll up (back): hard
middle button + scroll down (back): easy
left click + right click (left click first): disable hotkey

<b>How It Works & Customizing Hotkeys</b>

A hotkey is comprised of mouse press and mouse wheel events.

When you press a mouse button, the add-on searches for a hotkey where all the buttons you pressed beforehand are
written as 'press [button name]' and the last button you pressed as 'click [button name]'.
The same thing happens when you scroll: it searches for a hotkey where all the buttons that are being pressed
are written as 'press [button name]' and the scroll direction as 'wheel [direction]'.
If such hotkey exists, its corresponding action is executed.

<b>Notes</b>
If you have many long cards that require scrolling, having scroll hotkeys will not let you scroll your card
unless you turn off the add-on. (Left click + Right click by default)

You will not be able to access the context menu while reviewing unless you turn off the add-on.
